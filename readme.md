# Hi ! Welcome to Pass Out Day Project
I know this name is silly but it has a private story. I asked my exam preparation center teacher for a name (hardest part for every project) and it said to me in turkish "Bayilma Gunu". I translated and here we are.
This project is a way to me improve myself in making games from scratch.
If you have anything to ask me or get in contact my email is haydarcan_2003@hotmail.com
# Have a nice day!
